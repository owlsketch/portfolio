          The website was designed with a mobile-first approach. The experience we wanted visitors to have was one where they can instantly control an element in their environment from their phones.

          By the end of my contract with GRID we managed to create a handful of prototypes, one of which was <a href='https://twitter.com/frashed/status/997991289764298752'>featured by Mozilla&#39;s Internet Of Things team at MakerFaire in California</a>. Before leaving, we also managed to constuct a pixel wall with a total of 2,700 LEDs, with help from a <a href='https://makezine.com/projects/construct-giant-led-video-screen/'>Make article</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After having graduated from University, this was my first &#39;real&#39; project. It was my first opportunity to prove that I really had the skills to create with what I had been learning over the years. Nevertheless, I couldn’t have managed to pursue this project without the help from my friends at GRID. This project also helped show me the direction I need to be heading towards in my career.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope to one day be able to visit this project again. I accomplished many of the technical goals that were set out for me, however I believe there were other shortcomings. A greater effort could have been made to entice people into making their own pixel walls. Another shortcoming was the lack of a formal set of instructions for creating a pixel wall. In particular, the assembly of the container, which I had very little knowledge on how to approach myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hopefully one day I can build upon what is already in place and create a truly open source device that also succeeds in allowing makers to create their own devices and to learn along the journey. Regardless, I&#39;m proud of having built a device that entertained lots of people and had them interested in how I made it happen.

Should just do minimum. Then add and add parts of the whole.
Can't seem to work any other way tbh.
The basic structure is set it seems.

Need to clarify what the portfolio is about.

Portfolio should be simple af.
Just programming based work and blog as main components.
This is the 'front-page' content.

'hidden' or more nested content is skateboarding/photography/art/etc.

Need to have an easily adaptable design.
Hate feeling as if I'm stuck to one design.

ABOUT

owlsketch
Gibran García
creative programmer

Just some guy skating around Manhattan, raising more questions
than answers, and set on making the world just a little
more intriguing/terrifying; one project at a time.

Let's make something great together!
I’m passionate about making ideas into reality, and do so
through web-centric programming and design, while also unafraid
to add hardware to the mix. If you’re interested or have a project
in mind send me a message or check out my resume.
